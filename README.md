## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm Priya, a dedicated and tech-savvy final-year B.Tech student specializing in Software Technology at Centurion University of Technology and Management. 
With a strong foundation in programming languages like Python, Java, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS, along with hands-on experience in frameworks such as React.js, Spring Boot, and MySQL.
I am passionate about building efficient, user-friendly applications. My previous role as a web developer at Prodigy Infotech allowed me to apply and deepen my technical knowledge in a real-world setting, further fueling my commitment to the field.

Iâ€™m particularly drawn to opportunities that allow me to leverage my skills in problem-solving and innovation, and I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your team while continuing to grow professionally.
